* 50 new BTC / new block for block #0 ~ #209,999
* 25 new BTC / new block for block #210,000 ~ #419,999
* ...
* Halved every 21,000 blocks, i.e. about 4 years (10 minutes 1 block)

# Consensus Protocol

PoW (Proof-of-Work) + longest chain

Advantages:
* PoW computation is independent, which costs no back and forth communications among nodes
* PoW is costly, which has no other way but to cost the same price to falsify
* PoW is easy to verify independently

Disadvantages:
* PoW costs electricity power to compute
* Longest chain needs time to confirm its consensus, and it is a probabilistic process
